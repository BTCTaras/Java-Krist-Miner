# Java-Krist-Miner
A krist currency miner written in Java.

This software allows users to "mine" the cross-Minecraft-server currency, Krist.

The program currently allows users to make use of more than core, if they have more cores available, that is. Currently, only
3/2 of the total cores on one's machine may be used to prevent radically increased CPU usage.

However, it is important to note that your CPU usage will grow greatly when using this program. Be careful. Monitor the
usage and make use of less cores if your usage gets too high.

I HOLD NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS SOFTWARE. IF YOUR COMPUTER MELTS IN ITS CASE, IT'S YOUR FAULT, NOT MINE.

As always, you're welcome to use this software as you please. Simply give credit where credit is due.
